For the records, I need to find some time to organize it.

# About Interviews

# Advice

## The first ASA

1. Remember to ask details - clarifying questions - take notes on Doc
2. To come up with the non trivial cases
3. think about cases - main case, patch case which can be patched afterwards
4. get credit for good choice of data structure and for delivering why you choose, what else options there are and what kinds of algorithms can be related to.
5. Think about better solution while testing codes with cases
6. If you got time, walk through the codes for correcting typos.

	* Tell them whereâ€™re you going to, think, try, or implement.
	* Ask minutes to quietly tried methods
	* Ask for hints 
	* Remember as much as possible algorithms

## ASA with Google interns

* doing a lot of technical interviews just apply everywhere even if you do not really want to work there so you can practice the technical interview plus you might get a free flight if you make it to the onsites
* Was probably not yet scheduled pending if you accepted a previous host haha. I guess note to everyone, hosts have to apply for an intern and we basically line up in a first come first serve format to interview you during host matching. So you might be able to ask your recruiter how many hosts want to talk to you and if there are many you might also be able to choose which teams to talk to first. Just an insider tip 
* You don't have an offer unless a host picks you, and it is possible to pass the technical interviews and have no host pick you.
* For match project: Write about being interested in something other than ml in the questionnaire.
*  links to all of my projects and gave a short description of what I learned/tools I used
* <b>timeline</b> - 
	* 5 minutes of checking your assumptions: Ask questions. What are some example of some input and output? What are some interesting corner cases?
	* 5 minutes of discussing your overall approach. This is the brainstorming phase. Talk out loud. "I'm thinking I'd use data structure X, and I'd use it by doing Y". Your interviewer might ask something like "Can you do better?" and that's a signal that you should keep brainstorming before jumping into the code.
	* 20 minutes of coding. Implement the design you outlined. Test while you code.
	* 10 minutes of testing. Go through those corner cases you wrote down at the beginning.
* <b>Host matching interview</b>: Research a bit about the host's product before the interview so you're familiar with what they are talking about and you can ask them questions.
*  definitely be enthusiastic! It's okay if you're not familiar with the language or the product that the team uses. Ask lots of questions (I prepared a list of questions based on what team my potential host worked with)!
