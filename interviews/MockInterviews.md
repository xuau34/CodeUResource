# Procedure of interviews

1. Get a overall problem
2. Ask clarifying questions
	* Details
	* Character set - ASCII or Unicode
	* Edge cases
	* Extended attributes
3. Come up with a solution - **Better talking while thinking.**
	* Too hard - ask for only solving subproblem
	* Feel safe - ask if allowing standard libraires
4. Talk about your solution - **Using a case to demo your solution**
	* If you have multiple solutions, it's great to ananlyse one by one.
5. Ask if this solution is fine for coding right away
6. Code your solution - **Better talking while Coding.**
7. Run through your code by cases - **Talk out loud**
8. If there's no case left, talk about the complexity.
9. If the interviewer let you ask questions about Google, remember to thank them for their time and to know them if time allowed.
